  <h1>My Favorite Places</h1>
  <h2>Here are a few of my favorite places and why I like them!</h2>

  <h3>California</h3>
  <p>The entire state of California is a fun place, but I like it for a few <em>spasific</em> reasons:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>I get to see my extended family</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Seeing new wildlife on the hiking trails</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Going to Old Town Sacramento</strong>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>I grew up visiting Portland, and there are many reasons I <em>still</em> visit today!</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>The Zoo is still one of the best zoo's I've seen</strong>
    </li>
